To upload a project with large files to GitHub, you need to consider GitHub's file size limits and use tools like Git Large File Storage (LFS) if required. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Understand GitHub's File Size Limits
Individual file size limit: 100 MB (soft limit).
Repository size limit: 1 GB (recommended, though GitHub allows more for paid plans).
For files larger than 100 MB, use Git LFS.
2. Prepare Your Repository
Create a GitHub Repository:
Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository.
Clone the Repository Locally:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
3. Install Git LFS (if necessary)
Install Git LFS:
On Linux: sudo apt install git-lfs
On Mac: brew install git-lfs
On Windows: Use the Git for Windows installer and select Git LFS.
Initialize Git LFS in your repository:
bash
Copy code
git lfs install
Track large files using Git LFS:
bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.file-extension"
Replace *.file-extension with the file type or specific file name (e.g., *.zip or largefile.zip).
4. Add and Commit Your Project
Add all files to the repository:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with large files"
5. Push to GitHub
Push your files to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
If you've set up Git LFS, large files will be uploaded through it.

6. Monitor Uploads
Ensure that large files are successfully uploaded.
Verify the GitHub repository to check for file presence.
Tips for Managing Large Repositories
Split into smaller repositories: If your project exceeds 1 GB, consider splitting it into multiple repositories.
Use Releases: For large files like binaries or datasets, use GitHub Releases instead of storing them in the repository.

To upload a project with large files to GitHub through the command prompt, follow these detailed steps:

Step 1: Install Git
Ensure Git is installed on your system. Check by running:

bash
Copy code
git --version
If not installed, download and install Git from git-scm.com.

Step 2: Install Git Large File Storage (LFS)
Git LFS is required for files larger than 100 MB.

Install Git LFS:

Windows: Use the Git installer and select Git LFS during installation.
Linux: Run sudo apt install git-lfs.
MacOS: Run brew install git-lfs.
Initialize Git LFS:

bash
Copy code
git lfs install
Step 3: Initialize Git in Your Project
Navigate to your project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Initialize Git:
bash
Copy code
git init
Add the remote GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Step 4: Track Large Files
If your project contains large files (e.g., files over 100 MB), track them with Git LFS:

bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.file-extension"
For example, to track .zip files:

bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.zip"
Add the .gitattributes file created by Git LFS to the repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .gitattributes
Step 5: Add, Commit, and Push Files
Add all files:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with large files"
Push files to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
If your branch name is not main, replace main with your branch name.
Step 6: Verify Large File Upload
Check your GitHub repository to ensure all files, including large ones, are uploaded correctly.

Tips for Managing Large Files
Use Releases for Extremely Large Files: If some files are larger than GitHub's limits even with Git LFS, upload them as GitHub Releases.
Compress Files: Use tools like zip or tar to compress large files before uploading.
Split Large Repositories: Break down very large projects into modular repositories.

Here are six concise steps to upload a project with large files to GitHub using the command prompt:

Step 1: Install Git and Git LFS
Install Git from git-scm.com.
Install Git Large File Storage (LFS):
bash
Copy code
git lfs install
Step 2: Initialize a Local Git Repository
Navigate to your project folder and initialize Git:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
git init
Step 3: Track Large Files with Git LFS
Track file types or specific large files:

bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.file-extension"
For example:

bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.zip"
Step 4: Add and Commit Files
Add all project files and commit changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with large files"
Step 5: Connect to GitHub
Add your GitHub repository as the remote:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Step 6: Push to GitHub
Push your project to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
If your branch name is not main, replace main with your branch name.

Now, your project (including large files tracked by Git LFS) will be uploaded to GitHub!
